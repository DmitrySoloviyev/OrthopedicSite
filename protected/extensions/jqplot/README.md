jqPlot
============

### A Versatile and Expandable jQuery Plotting Plugin
 
jqPlot is a plotting plugin for the jQuery Javascript framework. jqPlot produces beautiful charts with many features including:
 
* Numerous chart style options.
* Line charts.
* Bar charts.
* Pie charts.
* Rotated axis text.
* Open Hi Low Close and Candlestick charts.
* Customize colors, shadows, markers, ticks and more.
* Date axes with customizable formatting.
* Automatic trend line computation.
* Tooltips and data point highlighting.
* Data point labels.
* Sensible defaults for ease of use.
 

### jqPlot's Strongest Feature is it's Plugability. 

Computation and drawing of lines, axes, shadows even the grid itself is handled by pluggable "renderers". Not only are the plot elements customizable, plugins can expand functionality of the plot too! There are plenty of hooks into the core jqPlot code allowing for custom event handlers, creation of new plot types, adding canvases to the plot, and more!
 
** //Important!// For jqplot builds r529 and above (0.9.7r529 and higher), you must explicitly enable plugins via either the { show: true } plugin option to the plot or by using the $.jqplot.config.enablePlugins = true; config options set on the page before plot creation. **
